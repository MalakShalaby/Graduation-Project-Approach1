# Project Title: AI-Enhanced Breast Cancer Recurrence Prediction, Metastasis Localization, and Image Interpretation: A Multi-Modal analysis

# Description:
This project aims to develop a predictive model for breast cancer using the Random Forest Classifier algorithm. The model utilizes datasets from various sources, including Metabric Breast Cancer dataset, Duke University Breast Cancer dataset, and MSK Breast Cancer dataset for training, and real patient data from Baheya hospital for validation.

# Requirements:
Python 3.x
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
Google Colab (for running the code in the provided notebook)

# Installation:
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
Install the required Python libraries using pip:
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

# Usage:
Open the provided notebook file (Final_Recurrence_Approach.ipynb) using Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
Mount Google Drive to access the datasets stored in '/content/drive'.
Execute the code cells sequentially to load the datasets, preprocess the data, train the Models, test and validate their performance.
Analyze the results obtained from the models evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
